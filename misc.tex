How to learn effectively:

1. Imitate the best until you're getting consistent results - find an expert and look at what they're doing
2. Learn to make distinctions - make finer and finer distinction until you can see why each approach works, understand why certain behaviours/commands result in specific outcomes
3. Create a value system - learn to assign higher and lower values to different mindsets, behavioursand results
4. Create variations on the best of those ideas, get more experience
5. Innovate, invent new things
