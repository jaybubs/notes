callable function means it must be a definition or a lambda
an equal sign means assignement, not a callable, it means a variable
For a simple web server for all files in the current directory (and subdirs), available to anyone on your network, use python -m http.server 7777 (for port 7777 and Python 3).

-c straight into bash will feed the command into python for immediate execution
\begin{verbatim}
	$ py -c "print(type(1))"
	<class 'int'>
\end{verbatim}

primitive datatypes are usually passed by value
complex datatypes (arrays, lists) are usually passed by reference
